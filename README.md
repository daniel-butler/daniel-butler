### Hi, I'm Daniel

SDE2 at Amazon. CPA before that.

I build things that do work automatically: data pipelines, agents, integrations. Most of what I build starts with a problem I was tired of doing manually or never wanted to manually. So I spent more time solving the problem than doing it. .

-  Bad jokes
- 🏃 Running iOs app, backend, analysis, and a coach agent that analyzes Apple Watch workouts
- 📊 Investment data pipeline pulling from yFiance, SEC, EDGAR, and FRED
