### Hi, I'm Daniel

SDE2 at Amazon. CPA before that.

I build things that do work automatically — data pipelines, agents, integrations. Most of what I build starts with a problem I was tired of solving manually.

- 🏃 Running coach agent that analyzes Apple Watch workouts via webhook
- 📊 Investment data pipeline pulling from SEC, EDGAR, and FRED
