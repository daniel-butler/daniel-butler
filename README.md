### Hi, I'm Daniel

Software Development Engineer at Amazon. CPA before that.

I enjoy building things that automate: data pipelines, agents, and integrations. Most of what I build starts with a problem I was tired of doing manually or never wanted to do manually. So, I spent more time solving the problem than doing it.

-  Bad jokes
- Running iOs app, backend, analysis, and a coach agent that analyzes Apple Watch workouts
- Investment data pipeline pulling from yFiance, SEC, EDGAR, FRED, and FDA
